# Design-and-Applications-of-Artificial-Intelligence
Neural networks algorithms are used in machine learning to help model nonlinear and complex problems and patterns of the real world. They are often used in pattern recognition as they are able to generalise and model a high volume of data with high volatility. Here is a study I carried out.
